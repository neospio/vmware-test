VMWare Test Project
=========
Requirements:

In angular build a signup form that toggles both between input and static text.

The form has a username, first name, last name, password, checkbox to accept terms, a select to choose male or female.

When I click on the static text, it changes to its respective input.

When the input is in focus and I hit “enter”  the input changes back to static text and it also updates the model, it doesn’t update the model as the user is typing.

Use angular best practices, don’t put all your code on one page.
